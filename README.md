# grips

save videos from the web easily

## about

you no longer need to worry about downloading a client downloader just to download videos from the web. simply open grips in your browser, and it will download them for you.

grips relies heavily on [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), so it can also be called a yt-dlp website like the others. But don't worry, grips has no ads, doesn't require you to download an app, doesn't pop up, and best of all, it's free.

grips is heavily inspired by [cobalt.tools](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt). of course, i made grips just for fun, but I will continue to strive to ensure this project is properly maintained.
